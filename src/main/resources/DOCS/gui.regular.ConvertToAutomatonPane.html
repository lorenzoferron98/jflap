<H1>Regular Expression to Automaton</H1>

<P>When the converter starts up, all that appears initially are two states (one initial and one final) with a
    transition. The transition between them contains the regular expression that we are trying to convert.</P>

<P>The critical idea of the converter is that at each stage of the conversion one has a valid machine where some
    transitions may happen to be regular expressions. Each regular expression may be recursively broken into smaller
    parts. The conversion is finished when the only transitions have only single (or zero) alphabet symbols on them.</P>

<P>There are four types of reductions that can be done on a regular expression:</P>

<ol>
    <li><P><IMG ALIGN="bottom" ALT="Shown, a+bc+d de-ored." HEIGHT="81" SRC="images/re2nfa_or.gif" WIDTH="281">
        Transitions are first broken according to the <DFN>or</DFN> symbol (+). For example, the expression
        <VAR>a+bc+d</VAR> can be broken into three subexpressions <VAR>a</VAR>, <VAR>bc</VAR> and <VAR>d</VAR>. An
        example of such a breakup is shown above.</P>

    <li>
        <P><IMG ALIGN="bottom" ALT="Shown, a(b+d)c* de-anded." HEIGHT="81" SRC="images/re2nfa_and.gif" WIDTH="281">
            Transitions that cannot be broken across
            <DNF>or</DNF>
            s are then broken across concatenations. For example, <VAR>a(b+d)c*</VAR> would be broken into the three
            subexpressions <VAR>a</VAR>, <VAR>(b+d)</VAR>, <VAR>c*</VAR> as shown above.
        </P>

    <li>
        <P><IMG ALIGN="bottom" ALT="Shown, a(b+d)c* de-stared." HEIGHT="55" SRC="images/re2nfa_star.gif" WIDTH="281"> If
            the transition does not break across either concatenation or
            <DNF>or</DNF>
            , then it may be a Kleene star (*) term, of the form <VAR>a*</VAR> or <VAR>(b+cd)*</VAR> (shown above) or
            something in that vein. In this case, the user effects the removal of the Klein star.
        </P>

    <li><P>Lastly, if a regular expression is of the form <VAR>(...)</VAR>, then the parentheses are simply removed from
        the transition.</P>
</ol>

The user interacts with the system in this way:

<ol>
    <li>In the first stage of the breakup, one uses the "de-expressionify" tool (<img align="top"
                                                                                      alt="De-expressionify tool icon"
                                                                                      height="16"
                                                                                      src="../ICON/de-expressionify.gif"
                                                                                      width="16">) to select a
        transition with a regular expression that can be broken down. If a particular transition cannot be broken down
        further, the user is gently chastised.
    </li>
    <li>If this is a reduction that requires additional lambda transitions, the user may add them with the transition
        tool (<img align="top" alt="Transition tool icon" height="16" src="../ICON/transition.gif" width="16">). A small
        message in the upper portion of the window will report how many transitions remain to add. If the user makes an
        error in the process of adding the transitions, the user will immediately receive a message to that effect. When
        all required transitions are added, the reduction is considered complete.
    <li>Steps 1 and 2 are repeated until there are no more transitions that can be "de-expressionified."
</ol>

<P>At any time, the user may press "Do Step" to complete the current RE reduction; if no RE reduction is in progress,
    this will choose a transition that remains to be reduced, and reduce it. "Do All" will complete the building of the
    automaton.</P>

<P>When the automaton is fully built, as with similar conversion operations the user has the option of placing the NFA
    in its own window with the "Export" button.</P>
